I HID IT UNDER THIS ONE:

Coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara)
The flowers along with the young leaves of this plant are edible. Coltsfoot flowers are eaten raw or can be mixed with salads to produce a good aromatic flavor. The flowerâ€™s head can be added to honey and stored into a jar for a couple of weeks before it can be used as a cough medicine.
